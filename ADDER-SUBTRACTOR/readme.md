# **ADDER-SUBTRACTOR CIRCUIT**
<p>The subtraction of unsigned binary numbers can be done most conveniently by means of complements . The subtraction A - B can be done by taking the 2’s complement of B and adding it to A . The 2’s complement can be obtained by taking the 1’s complement and adding 1 to the least significant pair of bits. The 1’s complement can be implemented with inverters, and a 1 can be added to the sum through the input carry.</p>

<p>The addition and subtraction operations can be combined into one circuit with one common binary adder by including an exclusive-OR gate with each full adder. The mode input M controls the operation. When M = 0, the circuit is an adder, and when M = 1, the circuit becomes a subtractor. Each exclusive-OR gate receives input M and one of the inputs of B . When M = 0, we have B { 0 = B. The full adders receive the value of B , the input carry is 0, and the circuit performs A plus B . When M = 1, we have B ^ 1 = B` and C0 = 1. The B inputs are all complemented and a 1 is added through the input carry. The circuit performs the operation A plus the 2’s complement of B . </p>
