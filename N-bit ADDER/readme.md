# **N-BIT ADDER**
<p>Parallel adder is a binary adder circuit implemented to add two binary number having N-bits (for example, to add 4-bit binary numbers, we use 4- bit parallel adder, and so on). As its name implies, the parallel adder is a digital combinational circuit that adds two binary numbers in parallel form and generates the arithmetic sum of those binary numbers in parallel form.</p>

<p>a full adder can perform addition of only two one-bit binary numbers consisting of two input bits and one input carry bit, i.e. addition of three bits. But in actual practice, we have to add such binary numbers whose length is more than one bit. To add such binary numbers, we use parallel binary adder which is capable of adding the two binary numbers of any bit length such as 4-bit, 5-bit, etc.We can implement an N-bit parallel adder with the help of full-adders connected in a chain fashion.</p>
