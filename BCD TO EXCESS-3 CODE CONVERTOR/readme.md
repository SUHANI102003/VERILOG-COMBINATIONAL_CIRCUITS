# **BCD TO EXCESS-3 CODE CONVERTOR**


## BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)
Binary-coded decimal is a system of writing numerals that assigns a four-digit binary code to each digit 0 through 9 in a decimal (base 10) number. Simply put, binary-coded decimal is a way to convert decimal numbers into their binary equivalents. In binary-coded decimal, each digit in a decimal base 10 number is represented as a group of four binary digits, or bits. Any base 10 number or digit can be represented in binary notation using binary-coded decimal.


## EXCESS-3
The excess-3 code is also treated as XS-3 code. The excess-3 code is a non-weighted and self-complementary BCD code used to represent the decimal numbers. This code has a biased representation. This code plays an important role in arithmetic operations because it resolves deficiencies encountered when we use the 8421 BCD code for adding two decimal digits whose sum is greater than 9.
We can easily get an excess-3 code of a decimal number by simply adding 3 to each decimal digit.
