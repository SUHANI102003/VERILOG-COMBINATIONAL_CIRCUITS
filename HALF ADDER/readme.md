# **HALF ADDER**


The half adder is a basic building block for more complex adder circuits such as full adders and multiple-bit adders. It performs binary addition of two single-bit inputs, A and B, and provides two outputs, SUM and CARRY.

The SUM output is the least significant bit (LSB) of the result, which is the XOR of the two inputs A and B. The XOR gate implements the addition operation for binary digits, where a “1” is generated in the SUM output only when one of the inputs is “1”.

The CARRY output is the most significant bit (MSB) of the result, indicating whether there was a carry-over from the addition of the two inputs. The CARRY output is the AND of the two inputs A and B. The AND gate generates a “1” in the CARRY output only when both inputs are “1”.
